When practcing a song, I sometimes want to play and record a very short part of it, listen to that in order to hear whether I got the timing right, then repeat, potentially repeating this many times in a row.
Putting down my bow to reset the recording every time is inconvenient and distracting when working on a section that's only seconds long, so I made this webpage, which records for a specified number of seconds, plays it back, then waits a specified number of seconds before starting over.
